# R TUTORIAL WITH MANY USEFUL COMMANDS #
########################################

# Note that any text following the character "#" on a line is a comment.


# SECTION 1: GETTING HELP
# -----------------------

# If you know the name of a command (say mean), here's how to get more information.

help(mean)  
?mean           # same as help(mean)
??mean          # searches for all functions related to the keyword 'mean'
example(mean)   # shows examples on how to use a command

# If you are looking to do something in R, say drawing a histogram, but you don't know
# the specific command name, in my opinion the easiest method is to use Google!



# SECTION 2: DATA STRUCTURES
# --------------------------

# You can store numbers, character strings, vectors and matrices into variables.
# The following are called assignment operations; they assign a value or object
# to a name.

x <- 5
y <- "Hello World!"
z <- x + sqrt(16) + cos(pi)

# You may then print the value of a variable simply by typing the name (e.g. z)
# or using the function print (e.g. print(z)).
# To construct a vector of values, they are several ways. Try the following commands.

vec1 <- 1:10
vec2 <- c(1,4,2,-10,-5)
vec3 <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charles")
vec1
vec3[2]
vec2[3:5]
log(vec1)

# You can append elements to the end of a vector:
vec1 <- append(vec1, 40)
vec1

# And you can take the "union" of two vectors (viewed as sets)
vec4 <- union(vec1, vec2);
vec4;




# You can also create a list of vectors
vec_list <- list(vec1, vec2, vec3)
vec_list

# To access individual elements in this list, you use [[ ]]
vec_list[[1]]
vec_list[[2]]
vec_list[[3]]

vec_list[[3]][2]



# A very useful data structure in R is the data frame. Think of a data frame
# as a spreadsheet, loosely speaking. Suppose I have a sample of 7 students, and I have
# measured the eye color and R score for each. Below is an example on how to creat
# a data frame.

eyecolor <- c("brown","brown","blue","brown","brown","brown","blue")
Rscore <- c(27.1,28.7,24.0,31.2,29.5,30.9,34.7)
MyData <- data.frame(eyecolor,Rscore)
MyData

# Note that the $ operator will access individual columns of the data frame.
MyData$eyecolor  
MyData$Rscore
mean(MyData$Rscore)



# SECTION 3: SAMPLING AND RANDOM NUMBERS
# --------------------------------------

# You may generate random samples from a given vector of outcomes.

outcomes <- 10:100
sample1 <- sample(outcomes,6)   # sampling without replacement! (by default)
sample1
marbles <- c("blue", "blue", "red")
sample2 <- sample(marbles, 10, replace=TRUE)   # sampling with replacement!
sample2

# All of the above assume by default that all outcomes are equally likely.
# We can also take a sample assuming not all outcomes are equally likely.
# Let's see the case of a (non-fai) die and assume that
# the outcome 1 has probability 0.5 and all other outcomes have probability 0.1
# Let's roll this die 20 times

outcomes <- 1:6
sample3 <- sample(outcomes, 20, replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1));
sample3



# SECTION 4: MORE ON VECTORS AND INDICES
# --------------------------------------

# Run the following code and discover what each command does by printing each variable.
# You can also read the help pages for each new command, e.g. help(rep).

U <- rep("toto", 5)
V <- rep("foo", 8)
C <- c(U, V)
C <- sample(C)
indices <- which(C == "foo")
C[indices]



# SECTION 5: RESTRICTING A VECTOR
# -------------------------------

eyecolor <- c("brown","brown","blue","brown","brown","brown","blue")
Rscore <- c(27.1,28.7,24.0,31.2,29.5,30.9,34.7)
MyData <- data.frame(eyecolor,Rscore)
MyData$age <- c(18,17,17,16,19,18,18)

# Suppose we would like to find the mean and standard deviation of a variable
# (say the age), but categorized by eye color. In other words, we want to calculate
# the average of people with brown eyes, and the average age of people with
# blue eyes separately.

# A first way is to restrict the variable as follows.
iblue <- which( MyData$eyecolor == "blue" )
ibrown <- which( MyData$eyecolor == "brown" )
mean( MyData$age[ iblue ] )
sd( MyData$age[ iblue ] )
mean( MyData$age[ ibrown ] )
sd( MyData$age[ ibrown ] )

# Another convenient way is to use the aggregate function.
aggregate( MyData$age, list(Name=MyData$eyecolor), mean, na.rm=TRUE)
aggregate( MyData$age, list(Name=MyData$eyecolor), sd, na.rm=TRUE)

# Note that if the data contains some NA values, they need to be ignored in
# most calculations, and therefore the need for the argument na.rm=TRUE
# in many functions. Another possibility is to directly remove those NA values:
vec <- c(0,1,NA,3,4,5,6,NA,NA,9,10)
vec <- vec[ !is.na(vec) ]         # keep only the non-NA values
vec



# SECTION 6: PLOTS
# ----------------

# Here are a few commands to generate some useful plots using
# the previously created data frame MyData.
hist(MyData$Rscore)                    # HISTOGRAM
pie(table(MyData$eyecolor))            # PIE CHART
barplot( table(MyData$age) )           # BAR CHART
plot(MyData$eyecolor, MyData$Rscore)   # BOX-PLOTS
plot(MyData$age, MyData$Rscore)        # SCATTER PLOT


x <- 1:20
y <- sample(1:20, replace=T)

# You can make your graphs better by adding your own title and labels for the axes.
plot(x,y, main="Scatter plot of random numbers vs integers",
     xlab="Integers", ylab="Random")

# And also change the range of x-values and y-values, which is particularly useful
# when zooming in a graph.
plot(x,y, xlim=c(5,15), ylim=c(0,12))

# Finally you can also produce plots in log-scale by specifying the option
# log='x' or log='y' or log='xy' in a plotting function.
x <- 2**(0:5)
y <- 10**(0:5)
plot(x,y, log='xy', main="Plot in log-log scale")

# You can also draw two functions on the same plot, here's an example
x <- seq(0, 3*pi, 0.1)                   # values from 0 to 3pi by increments of 0.1
plot(x, sin(x), type='l', col='blue')    # first function
lines(x, cos(x), type='l', col='red')    # add second function on the same plot




# SECTION 7: Intro to Programming
# ------------------------------

# Programming is fun. Let's see some interesting things you can do when you program...

#Let's simulate rolling a fair die:
rolled_value <- sample(1:6, 1)

rolled_value

# Now we learn about the IF statement
if (rolled_value == 1){
	print("The number 1 was rolled")
} else {
	print("A number other than 1 was rolled")
}

# Another example (the "!=" logical operator represents "NOT EQUAL")
if (rolled_value != 1){
	print("The number 1 was not rolled")
} else {
	print("The number 1 was rolled")
}

#And another one... (the "&" logical operator represents "AND")
if ( (rolled_value >= 2) & (rolled_value <= 4) ) {
	print("A number between 2 and 4 was rolled")
} else {
	print("Either 1 or 5 or 6 was rolled")
}



# Another useful gadget in programming is the FOR loop
# Let's use it to print all numbers from 1 to 15
for (i in 1:15){
	print(i)
}

# There is another type of loop that is useful: it is the WHILE loop
# Let's use it to print all numbers from 1 to 15 again
i <- 1
while (i <= 15){
	print(i)
	i <- i + 1
}


# Finally, a piece of code that is used often can be put in a "function"
# Much like a mathematical function, a function in this context
# can accept one or more inputs (called arguments) and then returns an output
# Let's define a function to simulate the following experiment (for a given number s):
#   a pair of dice is rolled until the sum of its values is equal to s
# The function will take as argument the number s and return the number of trials that were necessary to obtain the required sum

sumn <- function(s){
	# This IF statement is used to make sure the value of s given by user is valid
	# (the "|" logical operator represents "OR")
	if ( (s < 2) | (s > 12) ){
		print("ERROR: Invalid value of s")
	} else {
		n <- 0  # initializes the variable that will count the number of trials
		
		rolled_sum <- 0;  # this is the variable that will contain the sum of the numbers rolled
		
		while (rolled_sum != s){
			outcome <- sample(1:6, 2, replace = TRUE)
			rolled_sum <- outcome[1] + outcome[2]	# sum of the two rolled numbers is put into variable rolled_sum
			
			n <- n + 1		# add 1 to counter of number of trials
		}
		
		return(n)	# return the number of trials
	}
}

# Let's call this function:
sumn(5) # (this will call the function with the value of argument s equal to 5)
sumn(12) # (this will call the function with the value of argument s equal to 12)



# SECTION 8: Distributions
# ------------------------

# Binomial distribution
dbinom(5,10,0.4)   # p(5) for a binomial with n=10, p=0.4
pbinom(5,10,0.4)   # F(5) for a binomial with n=10, p=0.4
x = 0:10
plot(x, dbinom(x,10,0.4), type="h") # line plot of the binomial distribution

# Normal distribution
pnorm(2.123)    # cumulative standard normal probability up to z=2.123
qnorm(0.60)     # 60th percentile of the standard normal
x <- seq(-3,3,0.01)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type="l") # plot of the standard normal density function


# Here is a table of useful functions for the distributions we will see in class.
# To learn how to use these functions, remember to type help(<function_name>).

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Distribution   | Probability/density | Cumulative | Percentiles | Sampling |
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# binomial       | dbinom              | pbinom     | qbinom      | rbinom   |
# hypergeometric | dhyper              | phyper     | qhyper      | rhyper   |
# Poisson        | dpois               | ppois      | qpois       | rpois    |
# uniform        | dunif               | punif      | qunif       | runif    |
# t              | dt                  | pt         | qt          | rt       |
# chi-squared    | dchisq              | pchisq     | qchisq      | rchisq   |
# F              | df                  | pf         | qf          | rf       |
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------




# SECTION 9: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
# ---------------------------------

# Here are some useful commands to obtain some basic descriptive statistics.
# Note that you want these functions to ignore missing values (NA, meaning Not Available).

values <- c(0, -5, 4, 2, 1, 1, 10, 8, NA, 7, 2, -2, NA) 
summary(values, digits=6)   # provide mean and five-number summary 
sd(values, na.rm=TRUE)      # sample standard deviation 
length(values)              # length of vector
sum( is.na(values) )        # number of NA's


eyecolor <- c("brown","brown","blue","brown","brown","brown","blue")
Rscore <- c(27.1,28.7,24.0,31.2,29.5,30.9,34.7)
MyData <- data.frame(eyecolor,Rscore)
MyData$age <- c(18,17,17,16,19,18,18)

# We can calculate the correlation coefficient between two variables as follows:
cor(MyData$age, MyData$Rscore, use="complete.obs")



# SECTION 10: MORE ON PLOTS
# -------------------------

# For a scatter plot, you can also find the coefficient of the regression by using
# the function lm, and then draw the line on top of the scatter plot.
# Here's an example:
x <- 1:20
y <- sample(1:20, replace=T)
plot(x,y)
lm(y ~ x)      # order is important here, y ~ x means y is the dependent variable
abline(lm(y ~ x), col=2)
